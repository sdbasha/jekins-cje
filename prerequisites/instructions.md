# Prerequisites

Excercise will require the tooling listed below. Ensure that all of those tools have been installed before attending the training if you want to following along. The training does not reserve time for setting up or verifying the installed tools or their respective versions.

## Recommended preparation

* Attendees will need access to a Jenkins instance, either local or remote. We will walk through the [installation process during the class](../exercises/01-jenkins-installation/instructions.md), but please download all relevant binaries for your OS in advance. Please reference the Jenkins user documentation.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on the local machine
* A free [account on GitHub](https://github.com/) (optional, but recommended so you can pursue the exercises that use GitHub as a source code repository)
* Install [JDK 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (optional, but recommended so you can pursue the Java-based exercises)
* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (optional, but recommended so you can pursue the distributed builds exercise)
* Some of the later exercises will ask you create an account on external services e.g. Heroku or CodeCov. All of those services provide a free tier. Please set up the following accounts if you want to follow along:
    * [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)
    * [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    * [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/)
